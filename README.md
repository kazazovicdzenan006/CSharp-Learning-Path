# C# & .NET Learning Path 🚀

Welcome to my central repository dedicated to mastering C# and the .NET ecosystem. This project tracks my evolution from core OOP principles to advanced Enterprise-grade architectures and Web API development.

## 🎓 About This Journey
This repository is a collection of projects that have evolved alongside my skills. I started with simple console applications and progressed to implementing **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** patterns, and **RESTful Web APIs**.

## 🏗️ Technical Skill Set

### Core Backend & C#
- **Advanced OOP:** Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Records, and Tuples.
- **Functional Concepts:** Delegates, Events, and LINQ.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Extensive use of `async/await` for I/O operations.
- **Dependency Injection:** Proper use of IoC containers for decoupled code.

### Data & Persistence
- **Entity Framework Core:** Fluent API, Migrations, and **Table Per Type (TPT)** inheritance mapping.
- **SQL & Databases:** 3NF Normalization, complex querying, and Database Design (MS SQL Server).
- **Evolution:** Transitioned from local JSON storage to full relational database persistence.

### Architecture & API
- **Clean Architecture:** Strict separation of concerns (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers).
- **Design Patterns:** Repository Pattern, Unit of Work, and Service Layer.
- **Web API:** Full CRUD operations and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

## 📁 Project Roadmap

### 🏛️ SmartCity_Enterprise (The Core Masterpiece)
The culmination of my early projects (**Senzori**, **BookStore**, and **SmartCity**). 
- **Architecture:** Full Clean Architecture with decoupled projects.
- **Logic:** Manages complex urban systems including parking, cross roads, air quality sensors, and city libraries.
- **Status:** Transitioning from Console UI to a centralized Web API.

### 🧪 NextYearUniversityExam (Advanced Testing)
A collection of "Steroid-boosted" exams for upcoming university courses.
- **Exam2:** Upgraded a standard Console UI requirement into a full **Web API** with Swagger integration, showcasing a proactive approach to curriculum challenges.

### 🌐 Web API Development
- **FirstWebApi:** My initial entry into REST services.
- **Exam2 API:** Advanced implementation of controllers and DI.

### 📊 SqlTraining
Focused exercises on database design, relational algebra, and complex SQL scripts.

## 🚧 Roadmap & Next Steps
- [ ] **DTOs & AutoMapper:** Implementing Data Transfer Objects to decouple API models from Domain entities.
- [ ] **Security:** Implementing **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication.
- [ ] **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC).
- [ ] **Frontend:** Integration with **Angular**.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kazazovicdzenan006/CSharp-Learning-Path.git`
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in **Visual Studio 2026**.
3. Select the desired **Startup Project** (e.g., `SmartCity_Enterprise` or `Exam2`).
4. Press `F5` to build and run the application. 
   * *Note: For Web API projects, Swagger will automatically open in your default browser.*
